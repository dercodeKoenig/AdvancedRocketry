This project is a fork of Advanced Rocketry. We have made numerous repairs and changes to the original code, making it difficult to distinguish between the original MIT licensed code and our modifications. The original MIT licensed code can be found here: https://github.com/Advanced-Rocketry/AdvancedRocketry
